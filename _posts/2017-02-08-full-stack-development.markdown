## 6 Month Progression

A few months ago I decided to actively persue my interest in front end development and eventually became a full stack developer. Here's my progression!

### 1. Learning  
  
Joined Pluralsight, by far my best investment.

### 2. Projects  

Started working on projects that solved specific issues. I solicited ideas from friends and family and began building apps using different frameworks. Most recently I worked with a friend to build a dashboard to oversee personal investments on a car-building project. You can view it [here](https://gw-car-dashboard.herokuapp.com/). It's written using the MEAN stack and hosted on Heroku.  

### 3. Tools  

I found the right tools to use to foster a collaborative environment as well as optimize my development environment. I focused on opensource and freeware to get started. My front end project framework post can be found [here](http://avarghese.me/blog/development/2016/05/24/create-free-project-framework.html).

### 4. Teams  

Surrounded myself with likeminded people who wanted to improve their coding skills. MeetUps is another great way to build a software dev network. At my day job, I was especially lucky to have a great [Mentor](https://github.com/LarryBattleWork) that constantly pushed me to learn new things and develop tangible deliverables to showcase what I've learned. 

### 5. Branding  
  
Built out a suite of websites using what I learned. Helped me to increase my online footprint as well as showcase my skills.

### 6. Blogging  
  
Documented my progress for reference as well as to increase my online footprint.
  
## Summary  

That's pretty much it!
