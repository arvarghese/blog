A couple of months ago I got into a wreck that almost resulted in total loss for my car. During the period where damage was being assessed by my insurance, I started to let my mind wander and began researching cars again. With so many options avaiable, I spent more time refining my search based on criteria that satisfied both my wife and I's requirements, listed as follows:

Wants:  

> Under 65k starting  
> 4 Door Coupe style  
> 300+ hp  
> Cruise control with stop/go  
> Red seats  
> Ventilated/massaged seats  
> Ambient lighting


+  

Really Wants:  

> Panoramic roof  
> Frameless Doors  
> Remote start capabilities  
>  

+  

Keeping these factors in mind, I came up with a list options:  

<i class="fa fa-fw fa-car"></i>  Mercedes C63 - **$70k**  
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-car"></i>  Corvette Stingray - **$65k**  
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-car"></i>  Audi A7 - **$72k**  
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-car"></i>  BMW M3  - **$72k**  
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-car"></i>  Tesla Model S - **$71k**  

After lengthy discussions with family and friends, as well as a few test drives, I finally decided on the [Tesla](https://www.teslamotors.com/).
By far it was the most unique out of the bunch, and matched more of my **wants** than the other cars. What sold me was the fact that it was a completely electric car, no gas needed whatsoever! Sure, the other cars on the list had their advantages, mainly with power or flashy looks. But the overall package for a daily driver pointed me towards the Tesla. 

Another interesting tidbit, Tesla does not have dealerships, you actually just go on their site, configure your model, and place your order, just like you would on any other online product site. This removes haggling, drawn out discussions over financing, add-ons, etc. I've already placed the deposit and am currently waiting delivery of a new **2016 Tesla Model S 60**! Modding post to come..
