This place reminded me alot of Puerto Rico in that there is a lush jungle landscape contrasted with rollings hills/mountains and volcanoes, in addition to the cities and barely paved roads. Overall the trip was pretty fun, from hiking to get a good view of the Arenal to eating termites out of a nest. One of the main highlights are the hot springs of Costa Rica, naturally warm water coming from the surrounding volcanoes. One recommendation is rent your own car instead of doing a tour. Though the tours are great, rental cars are cheap (~13 $/day) and let you explore on your own time, allowing you to cover more and see what Costa Rica has to offer.
