We really didn't know what to expect from Thailand as we've heard many mixed reviews about both Bangkok and Phuket. After seeing both in person though I can freely say that this experiene was incredible and we will definitely be coming back.  

### Bangkok  
Our stay in Bangkok was relatively short, but we were able to cover quite a bit including three temples, the floating markets of Damnoen Saduak, and explore the nightlife on Khao San Road.  With cheap local transportation and markets/street food all over the place, there is always something to do. Do keep in mind that Bangkok is a big city, and with that comes pollution, traffic, and tourist traps. Putting those things aside though, the overall experience was pleasant.
  
 
### Phuket  
Phuket was the opposite of Bangkok. Wide spaces, fresh air, rolling hills, and clear blue water. As it is a popular tourist spot in Thailand it is very well maintained. It has accomodations to match any budget, tons of islands to hop, multiple white sand beaches, and a multitude of tours to satisfy all levels of adventure. In terms of activities, cost, and views, this is definitely one of the best places to go, and I would definitely go again.
