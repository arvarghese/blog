This was our third attempt at flying standby, the first two being to San Francisco and Orlando. Overall flight availability did not hinder us to much, and we were able to make it to Puerto Rico and back with a manageble delay. My wife has gone twice separately already, so this was the first time we went together, she was kind of like my tour guide. Considering we were only in Puerto Rico for one day, we got saw more than enough sights to say that I have seen Puerto Rico to my content. From charming old towns to amazing cave networks, to the rare bio lumenescent water in Bio Bay, Puerto Rico is definitely a place worth visiting once in your life.
