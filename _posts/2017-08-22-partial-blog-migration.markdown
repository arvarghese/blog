### Making Some Changes

So over the last two years I have been posting various content on this blog, ranging from coding, to technology, to travel. Its gotten to the point though where I want to start dedicating focus to the travel portion of my blog, and I don't think this blog is the right place for it. So for now I am experimenting with different platforms, weighing the useability, content availibity, ease of use, etc. Here are a few that I have started using, please check them out and let me know what you all think in the comments section below!
