### My Mavic Pro  
When it first arrived, it thought I ordered the wrong thing because the box was so small, but it was clearly labeled as the **DJI Mavic Pro**. It came with:  

+ > Drone body  
+ > 5 sets of propellers  
+ > Battery  
+ > Remote 
+ > Batter/Remote Charger  
+ > Warranty/quickstart guide  

Both the battery and the remote needed charging, so I plugged them in for about one hour. Afterwards it was time to take flight!
