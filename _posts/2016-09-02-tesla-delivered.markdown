Every morning I check my Tesla account for updates on the status of my car. Two weeks ago when I checked I finally saw the status that I've been waiting for for TWO months: 

### "Your Tesla Model S is Delivered" 

I went in on August 29th to pick it up, here's a [Good Read](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlZhDYtCinX_Wkb9OST-QBzervVp5yABMVBS266Q3W4/pub) on what to pay attention to when taking delivery of a Tesla. I didn't really pay attention to any of the walkthrough though as I was too distracted at how amazing it looked and thinking of all the different mods that I wanted to start on.   

I previously modded my Honda Accord coupe, which in my opinion came out very well. You can view all the pictures on [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/a9cnM) or checkout out my [previous post](http://localhost:4000/cars/2016/05/01/my-honda-accord.html) on this blog. Since I already gave that Accord to my wife, I was now thinking of doing a similar color scheme to the Tesla, just so we have matching cars! At this point I was still deciding about the colors, but I had started compiling everything I want to do to it, listed as follows in no particular order:

### Original List of Mods  

+ > Footwell lighting  
+ > Carbon fiber interior accents   
+ > Carbon fiber exterior trim and logos  
+ > Powdercoated wheels  
+ > Full vinyl car wrap  
+ > Calipers painted     
  
After a lot of thought and sampling, what I ended up doing was actually quite different in terms of color scheme and extent of modifications, but I am very happy with the results!  

### Completed Mods  

+ > Anodized Red Accents: handles, lug nuts, emblems, front air dams, rear spoiler lettering  
+ > Satin Black Wrap: window trim, tailgate spoiler, bumper chrome trim, side markers  
+ > Clear Bra: front bumper, side mirrors, headlights, fog lights, partial hood  
+ > Tint: 35% front, 15% rear  
+ > RGBW LED footwell lighting  
+ > MyPlates Custom Plate: [VAR TESLA]
  
**NOTE: clear bra and tint done at [SpeedShield](http://www.speedshieldusa.com/). I didn't want to risk messing up applying expensive material, so I thought I'd leave this to the professionals.  

At the moment I am completely satisfied with this car. Out the door it was already so amazing that I really didn't have to do much to bring out its uniqueness. At some point in the future I plan to change out the wheels for a set of black/gunmetal/red of the same size (19''), but for now I'm happy with the silly grin this car leaves on my face every time I take it for a spin.
