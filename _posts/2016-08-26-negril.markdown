We had booked this trip a while back, got a great deal through Spirit Airlines. Following our current trend, this is also just a weekend trip, spanning Friday to Sunday. My wife discovered the hotel and instantly fell in love with it. It reminded us of the Maldives, specifically the over-water villas and crystal clear water. It is about an hour and half drive out from the Montego Bay airport, and well worth the drive too! From the moment we stepped on the resort to the last few minutes before we regretfully said goodbye to the unbelievable nice staff, it was an amazing experience. The views, food very similar to our native cuisine, and activities were all top notch. I highly recommend this place to any one looking for a luxury resort getaway while in Jamaica.
