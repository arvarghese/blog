Today, it has been exactly 2 years since I proposed, and a little over a year that I've been married. Today especially puts me in a reflective mood. I am starting to think back on my life, the coincidences and events that transpired in order for me to be where I am today. I can tie the course of my life back to a few key moments: highschool graduation, confession to my first crush, data structures and algorithmic analysis in college, my first job, and my proposal. Honestly if any of these happened differently, I would not be in the same place I am today.
