My old crush reached out to me a few days ago. She told me she was writing a book. She was looking back on our relationship and trying to figure out what went wrong. Some context here: we met through a mutual friend, and over time we grew to like each other. We even went so far as to express our feelings for each other in a childish fit 
Its interesting how a few words/messages left unspoken led to such a dramatic change.
